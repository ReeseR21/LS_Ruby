# To add a space, it can be added in with the value or within the puts as + ' ' +. There must be a space between the quotation marks. Another way is with string interpolation as seen in the 3rd example. With string interpolation, double quotations must be used...not single.

# thousands = 3051 / 1000
# hundreds = 3051 / 100 
# can not do like this. I will not work. It will return 30
# hundreds = 3051 % 1000 / 100
# tens = 3051 % 100 / 10
# ones = 3051 % 10 

# puts "thousands: #{thousands}"
# puts "hundreds: #{hundreds}"
# puts "tens: #{tens}"
# puts "ones: #{ones}"
